    <!-- Methods in Inline Handlers -->

        <button v-on:click="say('what')">Say what</button>

        <!-- Sometimes we also need to access the original DOM event in an inline statement handler.
        You can pass it into a method using the special $event variable -->

        It is a very common need to call event.preventDefault() or event.stopPropagation() inside event handlers.
        Although we can do this easily inside methods, it would be better if the methods can be purely about data logic rather than having to deal with DOM event details.

        To address this problem, Vue provides event modifiers for v-on. Recall that modifiers are directive postfixes denoted by a dot.

        .stop
        .prevent
        .capture
        .self
        .once

        <a v-on:click.stop="doThis">do this</a>
        <!-- the submit event will no longer reload the page -->
        <form v-on:submit.prevent="onSubmit">submit</form>
        <!-- modifiers can be chained -->
        <a v-on:click.stop.prevent="doThat">do that</a>
        <!-- just the modifier -->
        <form v-on:submit.prevent>prevent submit no method</form>
        <!-- use capture mode when adding the event listener -->
        <!-- i.e. an event targeting an inner element is handled here before being handled by that element -->
        <div v-on:click.capture="doThis">...</div>
        <!-- only trigger handler if event.target is the element itself -->
        <!-- i.e. not from a child element -->
        <div v-on:click.self="doThat">...</div>

        <!-- Order matters when using modifiers because the relevant code is generated in the same order.
        Therefore using @click.prevent.self will prevent all clicks while @click.self.prevent will only prevent clicks on the element itself. -->
        <!-- the click event will be triggered at most once -->
        <a v-on:click.once="doThis">i can only be clicked once</a>
        <!-- Unlike the other modifiers, which are exclusive to native DOM events, the .once modifier can also be used on component events.
             If you haven’t read about components yet, don’t worry about this for now. -->

        On certain keyboards, specifically MIT and Lisp machine keyboards and successors, such as the Knight keyboard, space-cadet keyboard, meta is labeled “META”.

Why Listeners in HTML?

You might be concerned that this whole event listening approach violates the good old rules about “separation of concerns”. 
Rest assured - since all Vue handler functions and expressions are strictly bound to the ViewModel that’s handling the current view, it won’t cause any maintenance difficulty. 

In fact, there are several benefits in using v-on:

    1 .It’s easier to locate the handler function implementations within your JS code by skimming the HTML template.
    2. Since you don’t have to manually attach event listeners in JS, your ViewModel code can be pure logic and DOM-free. This makes it easier to test.
    3. When a ViewModel is destroyed, all event listeners are automatically removed. You don’t need to worry about cleaning it up yourself.
