    <!-- Guided from https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html -->
    <!--
        Directives are special attributes with the v- prefix. 
        Directive attribute values are expected to be a single JavaScript expression (with the exception for v-for, which will be discussed later). 
        A directive’s job is to reactively apply side effects to the DOM when the value of its expression changes. 
        -->


<div id="app">
    <!--
        Let’s review the example we saw in the introduction.
        Here, the v-if directive would remove/insert the <p> element based on the truthiness of the value of the expression seen.
        -->
    <p v-if="seen">Now you see me</p>

    <!-- # Arguments -->

    <!-- Some directives can take an “argument”, denoted by a colon after the directive name. 
        For example, the v-bind directive is used to reactively update an HTML attribute -->

    <a v-bind:href="url">{{ url }}</a>

    <!-- 
        Here href is the argument, which tells the v-bind directive to bind the element’s href attribute to the value of the expression url
        -->

    <!--
        Another example is the v-on directive, which listens to DOM events.
        Here the argument is the event name to listen to. We will talk about event handling in more detail too
        -->

    <a v-on:click="doSomething">click me</a>

    <!-- # Modifiers -->

    <!-- 
        Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. 
        For example, the .prevent modifier tells the v-on directive to call event.preventDefault() on the triggered event
        -->

    <form v-on:submit.prevent="onSubmit"></form>

    <!-- # Shorthands -->

    <!-- 
        The v- prefix serves as a visual cue for identifying Vue-specific attributes in your templates. 
        This is useful when you are using Vue.js to apply dynamic behavior to some existing markup, but can feel verbose for some frequently used directives. 
        At the same time, the need for the v- prefix becomes less important when you are building an SPA where Vue.js manages every template. 
        Therefore, Vue.js provides special shorthands for two of the most often used directives, v-bind and v-on
        -->

    <!-- v-bind Shorthand -->

    <!-- full syntax -->
    <a v-bind:href="url">{{ url }}</a>
    <!-- shorthand -->
    <a :href="url">{{ url }}</a>


    <!-- v-on Shorthand -->

    <!-- full syntax -->
    <a v-on:click="doSomething">click me</a>
    <!-- shorthand -->
    <a @click="doSomething">click me</a>

    <!-- They may look a bit different from normal HTML, but : and @ are valid chars for attribute names and all Vue.js supported browsers can parse it correctly. 
        In addition, they do not appear in the final rendered markup. 
        The shorthand syntax is totally optional, but you will likely appreciate it when you learn more about its usage later. -->
