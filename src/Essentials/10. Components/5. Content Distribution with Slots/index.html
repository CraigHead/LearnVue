    <!-- Guided from https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Content-Distribution-with-Slots  -->

    <!-- 
        When using components, it is often desired to compose them like this:

        <app>
            <app-header></app-header>
            <app-footer></app-footer>
        </app>

        There are two things to note here:
            1. The <app> component does not know what content it will receive. It is decided by the component using <app>.
            2. The <app> component very likely has its own template.

        To make the composition work, we need a way to interweave the parent “content” and the component’s own template. 
        This is a process called content distribution (or “transclusion” if you are familiar with Angular). 
        Vue.js implements a content distribution API that is modeled after the current Web Components spec draft, using the special <slot> element to serve as distribution outlets for the original content.
     -->

    <!--  
        # Compilation Scope

        Before we dig into the API, let’s first clarify which scope the contents are compiled in. 
        Imagine a template like this:

        <child-component>
            {{ message }}
        </child-component>

        Should the message be bound to the parent’s data or the child data? 
        The answer is the parent. 
        
        A simple rule of thumb for component scope is
            |
            | Everything in the parent template is compiled in parent scope; everything in the child template is compiled in child scope.
            |

        A common mistake is trying to bind a directive to a child property/method in the parent template
        
        this does NOT work:
        <child-component v-show="someChildProperty"></child-component>

        Assuming someChildProperty is a property on the child component, the example above would not work. 
        The parent’s template is not aware of the state of a child component.

        If you need to bind child-scope directives on a component root node, you should do so in the child component’s own template:
        Vue.component('child-component', {
            // this does work, because we are in the right scope
            template: '<div v-show="someChildProperty">Child</div>',
            data: function () {
                return {
                someChildProperty: true
                }
            }
        });

        Similarly, distributed content will be compiled in the parent scope.

    <div id="app1">

        <!-- # Single Slot -->


        <!-- 
            Parent content will be discarded unless the child component template contains at least one <slot> outlet. 
            When there is only one slot with no attributes, the entire content fragment will be inserted at its position in the DOM, replacing the slot itself.

            Anything originally inside the <slot> tags is considered fallback content. 
            Fallback content is compiled in the child scope and will only be displayed if the hosting element is empty and has no content to be inserted.

            Suppose we have a component called my-component with the following template 

            <div>
            <h2>I'm the child title</h2>
            <slot>
                This will only be displayed if there is no content
                to be distributed.
            </slot>
            </div>
        -->

        <div>
            <h1>I'm the parent title</h1>
            <my-component>
                <p>This is some original content</p>
                <p>This is some more original content</p>
            </my-component>
            <my-component></my-component>
        </div>


    </div>


    <script>

        Vue.component('my-component', {
            template: '\
                <div>\
                    <h2>I\'m the child title</h2>\
                    <slot>\
                        This will only be displayed if there is no content\
                        to be distributed.\
                    </slot>\
                </div>'
        });

        new Vue({
            el: '#app1',
            data: {
            }
        });

    </script>

    <div id="app2">

        <!-- # Named Slots -->
        <!-- 

        <slot> elements have a special attribute, name, which can be used to further customize how content should be distributed. 
        You can have multiple slots with different names. 
        A named slot will match any element that has a corresponding slot attribute in the content fragment.

        There can still be one unnamed slot, which is the default slot that serves as a catch-all outlet for any unmatched content. 
        If there is no default slot, unmatched content will be discarded.

    <!-- # Destructuring -->

    <!-- 
        slot-scope's value is in fact a valid JavaScript expression that can appear in the argument position of a function signature. 
        This means in supported environments (in single-file components or in modern browsers) you can also use ES2015 destructuring in the expression: 

        <child>
          <span slot-scope="{ text }">{{ text }}</span>
        </child>
    -->

<child>
  <span slot-scope="{ text }">{{ text }}</span>
