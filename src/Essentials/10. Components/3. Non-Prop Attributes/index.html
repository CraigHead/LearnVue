    <!-- Guided from https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Non-Prop-Attributes -->

    <!-- A non-prop attribute is an attribute that is passed to a component, but does not have a corresponding prop defined. -->

    <!-- While explicitly defined props are preferred for passing information to a child component, authors of component libraries can’t always foresee the contexts in which their components might be used. 
         That’s why components can accept arbitrary attributes, which are added to the component’s root element. -->

    <div id="app">
        <!-- For example, imagine we’re using a 3rd-party bs-date-input component with a Bootstrap plugin that requires a data-3d-date-picker attribute on the input. 
            We can add this attribute to our component instance -->

        <!-- <bs-date-input data-3d-date-picker="true"></bs-date-input> -->

        <!-- And the data-3d-date-picker="true" attribute will automatically be added to the root element of bs-date-input. -->


        <!-- # Replacing/Merging with Existing Attributes -->

        <!-- Imagine this is the template for bs-date-input: -->

        <!-- <input type="date" class="form-control"> -->

        <!-- To specify a theme for our date picker plugin, we might need to add a specific class, like this: -->

        <!-- <bs-date-input data-3d-date-picker="true" class="date-picker-theme-dark"></bs-date-input> -->

        <!-- In this case, two different values for class are defined: form-control, which is set by the component in its template date-picker-theme-dark,
        which is passed to the component by its parent For most attributes, the value provided to the component will replace
        the value set by the component. 
        So for example, passing type="large" will replace type="date" and probably break
        it! Fortunately, the class and style attributes are a little smarter, so both values are merged, making the final
        value: form-control date-picker-theme-dark. -->
