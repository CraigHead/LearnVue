        <!-- # Authoring Reusable Components -->

        <!-- 
        
            When authoring components, it’s good to keep in mind whether you intend to reuse it somewhere else later. 
            It’s OK for one-off components to be tightly coupled, but reusable components should define a clean public interface and make no assumptions about the context it’s used in. 
        
            The API for a Vue component comes in three parts - props, events, and slots:
                * Props allow the external environment to pass data into the component
                * Events allow the component to trigger side effects in the external environment
                * Slots allow the external environment to compose the component with extra content.

            With the dedicated shorthand syntaxes for v-bind and v-on, the intents can be clearly and succinctly conveyed in the template:

            <my-component
                :foo="baz"
                :bar="qux"
                @event-a="doThis"
                @event-b="doThat">
                <img slot="icon" src="...">
                <p slot="main-text">Hello!</p>
            </my-component>
        -->
        

    </div>


    <script>
        vm = new Vue({
            el: '#app',
            data: {
            }
        });

    </script>
