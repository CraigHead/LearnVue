    <!-- # What are Components?
            Components are one of the most powerful features of Vue.
            They help you extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code.
            At a high level, components are custom elements that Vue’s compiler attaches behavior to.
            In some cases, they may also appear as a native HTML element extended with the special is attribute.

    <!-- # Global Registration -->
    
<script>
    

    // We’ve learned in the previous sections that we can create a new Vue instance with
    //new Vue({
    //    el: '#some-element'
    //    // options
    //});

    // To register a global component, you can use Vue.component(tagName, options). For example
    //Vue.component('some-component', {
    //    // options
    //});

    // *** Note that Vue does not enforce the W3C rules for custom tag names (all-lowercase, must contain a hyphen) though following this convention is considered good practice.

</script>
    
    <!-- Once registered, a component can be used in an instance’s template as a custom element, <my-component></my-component>. 
         Make sure the component is registered before you instantiate the root Vue instance.Here’s the full example: -->

<div id="app">
    <my-component></my-component>
</div>
    
<script>
    // register
    Vue.component('my-component', {
        template: '<div>A custom component!</div>'
    })


    vm = new Vue({
        el: '#app',
    });
</script>
    
    <!-- # Local Registration -->

<!-- You don’t have to register every component globally. 
     You can make a component available only in the scope of another instance/component by registering it with the components instance option -->
    
    
<div id="app2">
    <my-component></my-component>
</div>



<script>
    var child = {
        template: '<div>A locally registered custom component!</div>'
    }

    vm2 = new Vue({
        el: '#app2',
        components: {
            // <my-component> will only be available in parent's template
            'my-component': child
        }
    });

</script>
    
    <!-- # DOM Template Parsing Caveats -->

<!-- 
        When using the DOM as your template (e.g. using the el option to mount an element with existing content), you will be subject to some restrictions that are inherent to how HTML works, because Vue can only retrieve the template content after the browser has parsed and normalized it. 
        Most notably, some elements such as <ul>, <ol>, <table> and <select> have restrictions on what elements can appear inside them, and some elements such as <option> can only appear inside certain other elements. 

        This will lead to issues when using custom components with elements that have such restrictions, for example:

        <table>
            <my-row>...</my-row>
        </table>
    
        The custom component <my-row> will be hoisted out as invalid content, thus causing errors in the eventual rendered output. 
        A workaround is to use the is special attribute

        <table>
            <tr is="my-row"></tr>
        </table>
    
        It should be noted that these limitations do not apply if you are using string templates from one of the following sources:

        * <script type="text/x-template">
        * JavaScript inline template strings
        * .vue components

        Therefore, prefer using string templates whenever possible.

    <!-- # 'data' Must Be a Function -->
    
<script>
    // Most of the options that can be passed into the Vue constructor can be used in a component, with one special case: data must be a function. In fact, if you try this:

    //Vue.component('my-component', {
    //    template: '<span>{{ message }}</span>',
    //    data: {
    //        message: 'hello'
    //    }
    //})

    // Then Vue will halt and emit warnings in the console, telling you that data must be a function for component instances. 
</script>
    
    <!-- It’s good to understand why the rules exist though, so let’s cheat. -->

<div id="example-2">
    <simple-counter></simple-counter>
    <simple-counter></simple-counter>
    <simple-counter></simple-counter>
</div>
    

<script>
    var data = { counter: 0 };

    Vue.component('simple-counter',
        {
            template: '<button v-on:click="counter += 1">{{ counter }}</button>',
            // data is technically a function, so Vue won't
            // complain, but we return the same object
            // reference for each component instance
            //data: function() {
            //    return data;
            //}

            // Since all three component instances share the same data object, incrementing one counter increments them all! Ouch. Let’s fix this by instead returning a fresh data object:
            data: function () {
                return {
                    counter: 0
                }
            }

        });

    new Vue({
        el: '#example-2'
    });

</script>
    
<div id="example-3">
    <simple-counter></simple-counter>
    <simple-counter></simple-counter>
    <simple-counter></simple-counter>
</div>
    
<!-- # Composing Components -->

<!-- 
    Components are meant to be used together, most commonly in parent-child relationships: component A may use component B in its own template. 
    They inevitably need to communicate to one another: the parent (A) may need to pass data down to the child (B), and the child (B) may need to inform the parent (A) of something that happened in the child. 
    However, it is also very important to keep the parent and the child as decoupled as possible via a clearly-defined interface. 
    This ensures each component’s code can be written and reasoned about in relative isolation, thus making them more maintainable and potentially easier to reuse.

    In Vue, the parent-child component relationship can be summarized as props down, events up. 
    The parent passes data down to the child via props, and the child sends messages to the parent via events. 
    Let’s see how they work next.
