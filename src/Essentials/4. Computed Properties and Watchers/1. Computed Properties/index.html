        In-template expressions are very convenient, but they are meant for simple operations. 
        Putting too much logic in your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain. 
        For example
        -->
        {{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}
    
    <!-- 
        At this point, the template is no longer simple and declarative. 
        You have to look at it for a second before realizing that it displays message in reverse. 
        The problem is made worse when you want to include the reversed message in your template more than once.

        That’s why for any complex logic, you should use a computed property.
        -->
    
    <!-- # Basic Example -->

    <p>Original message: "{{ message }}"</p>
    <p>Computed reversed message: "{{ reversedMessage }}"</p>

    <!-- 
    
    Below we have declared a computed property reversedMessage.
    The function we provided will be used as the getter function for the property vm.reversedMessage.

    You can open the console and play with the example vm yourself.
    The value of vm.reversedMessage is always dependent on the value of vm.message

    
    console.log(vm.reversedMessage); // => 'moc.elgoog//:sptth'
    vm.message = 'Goodbye'
    console.log(vm.reversedMessage); // => 'eybdooG'
    
        -->


    <!-- 
        You can data-bind to computed properties in templates just like a normal property. 
        Vue is aware that vm.reversedMessage depends on vm.message, so it will update any bindings that depend on vm.reversedMessage when vm.message changes. 
        And the best part is that we’ve created this dependency relationship declaratively: the computed getter function has no side effects, which makes it easier to test and understand
        -->

    <!-- # Computed Caching vs Methods -->

    <!-- You may have noticed we can achieve the same result by invoking a method in the expression -->
    <p>Reversed message: "{{ reverseMessage() }}"</p>

    <!-- Instead of a computed property, we can define the same function as a method instead. 
        For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly the same. 
        However, the difference is that computed properties are cached based on their dependencies. 
        A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its dependencies have changed. 
        This means as long as message has not changed, multiple access to the reversedMessage computed property will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the function again.
        -->

    <!-- 
        This also means the following computed property will never update, because Date.now() is not a reactive dependency
        -->
    <p>Computed Date: {{ computedNow }}</p>
    <p>Method Date: {{ methodNow() }}</p>

    <!-- 
        In comparison, a method invocation will always run the function whenever a re-render happens.

        Why do we need caching? Imagine we have an expensive computed property A, which requires looping through a huge Array and doing a lot of computations. 
        Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on A. 
        Without caching, we would be executing A’s getter many more times than necessary! 
        In cases where you do not want caching, use a method instead.

    <!-- # Computed vs Watched Property -->
    <!--
        Vue does provide a more generic way to observe and react to data changes on a Vue instance: watch properties.

        When you have some data that needs to change based on some other data, it is tempting to overuse watch - especially if you are coming from an AngularJS background.
        However, it is often a better idea to use a computed property rather than an imperative watch callback.
        Consider this example:
        -->

    <div id="watchedDemo">{{ fullName }}</div>

    <script>
        
        var vm2 = new Vue({
            el: '#watchedDemo',
            data: {
                firstName: 'Foo',
                lastName: 'Bar',
                fullName: 'Foo Bar'
            },
            watch: {
                firstName: function (val) {
                    this.fullName = val + ' ' + this.lastName
                },
                lastName: function (val) {
                    this.fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + val
                }
            }
        });
            
    </script>

    <!-- The above code is imperative and repetitive. Compare it with a computed property version -->

    <div id="computedDemo">{{ fullName }}</div>

    <script>

        var vm3 = new Vue({
            el: '#computedDemo',
            data: {
                firstName: 'Foo',
                lastName: 'Bar'
            },
            computed: {
                fullName: function () {
                    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
                }
            }
        });

    </script>

    <!-- # Computed Setter -->

    <!-- 
        Computed properties are by default getter-only, but you can also provide a setter when you need it
        -->

    <div id="computedSetter">{{ fullName }}</div>

    <!-- Now when you run vm.fullName = 'John Doe', the setter will be invoked and vm.firstName and vm.lastName will be updated accordingly. -->

    <script>

        var vm4 = new Vue({
            el: '#computedSetter',
            data: {
                firstName: 'Foo',
                lastName: 'Bar'
            },
            computed: {
                fullName: {
                    // getter
                    get: function () {
                        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
                    },
                    // setter
                    set: function (newValue) {
                        var names = newValue.split(' ')
                        this.firstName = names[0]
                        this.lastName = names[names.length - 1]
                    }
                }
            }
        });
