    /* Passing Data with Props
       Every component instance has its own isolated scope. This means you cannot (and should not) directly reference parent data in a child component’s template. Data can be passed down to child components using props.
        A prop is a custom attribute for passing information from parent components. A child component needs to explicitly declare the props it expects to receive using the props option */
